# BloodGo

Android Application for Blood Donation.

IDEA : Users sign up as either donors or seekers with some general information and blood group. Whenver a seeker is in need of blood she can 
issue a request on the app with specific details of like quantity of blood requirement, place of donation etc. The app will the app will then searh
for donors in the given area. This search will be in a certain radius which is set by the user. Once the donor is spotted in the radius, a notification would
be sent to him and he can accept that to donate blood. Once the donor is on the way to donate blood, he can inform the seeker that he has left 
for the location and the seeker can track him.
